/**
 * This class computes a minimum spanning tree on an undirected
 * graph using Prims' algorithm.
 *
 * The input data describes the edges of the graph with integer
 * edge costs. It has the format:
 *
 *     [number_of_nodes] [number_of_edges]
 *     [one_node_of_edge_1] [other_node_of_edge_1] [edge_1_cost]
 *     [one_node_of_edge_2] [other_node_of_edge_2] [edge_2_cost]
 *     â€¦
 *
 * For example, the third line of the file is "2 3 -8874",
 * indicating that there is an edge connecting vertex #2 and
 * vertex #3 that has cost -8874.
 * 
 * We do NOT assume that edge costs are positive, nor do we
 * assume that they are distinct.
 * 
 * We report the overall cost of a minimum spanning tree (an
 * integer, which may or may not be negative).
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: This graph is small enough that the
 * straightforward O(mn) time implementation of Prim's algorithm
 * should work fine. 
 *
 * OPTIONAL: For those of you seeking an
 * additional challenge, try implementing a heap-based version.
 * The simpler approach, which should already give you a healthy
 * speed-up, is to maintain relevant edges in a heap (with keys =
 * edge costs). The superior approach stores the unprocessed
 * vertices in the heap, as described in lecture. Note this
 * requires a heap that supports deletions, and you'll probably
 * need to maintain some kind of mapping between vertices and
 * their positions in the heap.
